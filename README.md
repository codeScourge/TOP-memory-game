# 💭The project
This is a memory game project build as an assignement for [the odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card), with the intention to deepen
ones understanding of the useEffect and useState React hooks. 

The objective is simple: try to click each image only once; if you do that with every shown image, you move on to the next level and now have 3 more images you have to worry about.

# 🖥️ demo
The project was deployed on Vercel, you can check it out [here](https://top-memory-game-ten.vercel.app)
